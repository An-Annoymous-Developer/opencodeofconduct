_Update: We will not be continuing work on the open code of conduct. See [our followup post](http://todogroup.org/blog/followup-open-code-of-conduct/) for more information._

We recommend you adopt a code of conduct that fits the needs of your community. Here are a few communities and projects that established code of conducts and diversity statements:

* Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/
* Python: https://www.python.org/community/diversity/
* Ubuntu: http://www.ubuntu.com/about/about-ubuntu/conduct
* Contributor Covenant: http://contributor-covenant.org/
* Geek Feminism: http://geekfeminism.org/about/code-of-conduct/
* Citizen Code of Conduct: http://citizencodeofconduct.org/
